## DS boundaries

> [!NOTE]
> The Data Science (DS) Boundary in a software system encompasses the integration and application of data science 
> methodologies and machine learning technologies. This boundary is pivotal for analyzing large sets of data to extract 
> meaningful insights, develop predictive models, and implement machine learning algorithms. It involves processes such 
> as data analysis, model training, and predictive analytics. The DS boundary plays a crucial role in enhancing 
> decision-making processes, automating complex tasks, and driving innovation by leveraging data-driven insights. 
> This boundary is essential in turning raw data into actionable intelligence, providing a competitive edge through 
> advanced data capabilities.
